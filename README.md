# Test Processing Tool Documentation.

## Overview
The Test Processing Tool is a versatile utility designed to simplify text processing using regular expressions (regex).
It allows users to:
- Check if a given text matches a specific regex pattern.
- Search for specific patterns within a text.
- Replace parts of a text based on regex patterns.

This tool is highly useful for developers, data analysts, and anyone dealing with text processing tasks, making regex operations more intuitive and accessible.

## Importance of the project.
Regular expressions are powerful tools for text processing, but they can be intimidating for beginners and tedious for repetitive tasks.
The Test Processing Tool addresses these challenges by providing a user-friendly interface for:
- Quickly validating regex patterns.
- Testing text transformations without writing additional code.
- Learning regex by observing real-time results.

This tool bridges the gap between the complexity of regex and its practical applications, making it an indispensable utility in text processing workflows.

## How to run the application
1. **Clone the repository:** Clone the project's repository to your local machine using:
   `git clone https://github.com/EssilfieBernard/Scrum-Text-Processing-Tool.git`
2. **Installation:** Ensure you have the required dependencies installed to run the application. If itâ€™s a standalone executable, simply launch the application.
3. **Launching the tool:** Run the tool by executing the main script in your development environment or opening the provided executable file.
4. **Interface overview:**
    - **Input Text Field:** Where users enter the text to process.
    - **Regex Input Field:** Where users specify the regex pattern.
      - **Actions:** Buttons or options for the following functionalities:
          - **Match:** Verify if the text matches the regex.
          - **Search:** Find occurrences of the pattern in the text.
          - **Replace:** Replace text matching the pattern with specified content.
          - **Clear:** It clears all the text fields.
          - **History Log:** It's where you see all the operations that have been performed.



## Problems Solved by the Application.

1. **Regex Complexity:** Simplifies the use of regex by providing a real-time interactive environment.
2. **Error Reduction:** Minimizes errors in regex patterns through immediate feedback and testing.
3. **Efficiency:** Accelerates tasks like pattern matching, text substitution, and data validation.
4. **Accessibility:** Makes regex accessible to non-programmers by offering an intuitive interface.

## How to Use the Application.
1. **Launch the Tool:** Open the application.
2. **Enter Text:** Input the text you want to process in the text field.
3. **Specify Regex Pattern:** Provide the desired regex pattern in the regex input field.
4. **Select Action:**
    - ***Match:*** Click the "Match" button to determine if the text matches the regex pattern. The result (match/no match) will be displayed.
    - ***Search:*** Click the "Search" button to find and highlight all occurrences of the pattern in the text.
    - ***Replace:*** Enter the replacement text in the provided field and click "Replace" to substitute matching text with the new content. The updated text will be displayed.
    - ***Clear:*** To clear all the text fields.
5. **View Results:** Results will be shown immediately in the designated output area.
